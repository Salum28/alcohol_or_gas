# Alcohol Or Gas App

The following project was made in a Flutter course i made, and the main goals of this app were:

* Learn how to work with toasts using fluttertoast package;
* Learn how to work with text fields and validations;

Also, one of the app's goals was to pratice layout creation and customization.
## How the App Works

When you inicialize the app, you will see two text fields, one for the alcohol price and other for the gas price. When you fill both of them and click the button, a calculation will be made to compare them and the result will be shown in your screen.

If the result is greater than 7, Alcohol is better than gas, otherwise, Gas is better.
